// * Optimizing the Bubble Sort algorithm

// ! The reason why we want to optimize any algorithm
// ! is because we will NEVER know the size of the array in real life
// ! It can have 10 elements or 10 thousand elements, or even 10 million elements
// ! depending on what we are doing

// ! And if our algorithms aren't optimized, they can perform
// ! MANY redundant operations which will just take more time

// ! So let's try to optimize this thing! ðŸ’ª

// ! Pikachu, I choose you!
let myList = [4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 0, 1, 5]

// ! Now let's write out Bubble Sort algorithm again
// * Bubble sort algorithm - not optimized
for (let k = 0; k < myList.length; k++) {
	for (let i = 0; i < myList.length - 1; i++) {
		if (myList[i] > myList[i + 1]) {
			// Swap
			let temp = myList[i]
			myList[i] = myList[i + 1]
			myList[i + 1] = temp
		}
	}
}

// * 1. Optimizing the outer loop
// ! Let's run through our algorithm by hand, using a really small array
let smallArray = [30, 20, 10]
// ! Remember, in our current algorithm, the outer loop will execute N (3) TIMES

// ! Note: We will go through the outer loop only
// ! Note: We will label the sorted elements with a parentheses ()

// * Outer loop FIRST iteration finishes -> the LARGEST item (30) is sorted
// * -> smallArray is now [20, 10, (30)]

// * Outer loop SECOND iteration finishes -> the SECOND LARGEST item (20) is sorted
// * -> smallArray is now [10, (20), (30)]

// * Outer loop THIRD iteration finishes -> the THIRD LARGEST item (10) is sorted
// * -> smallArray is now [(10), (20), (30)]

// ! BUT WAIT, the array was already sorted in the SECOND ITERATION
// ! This is because of the nature of the algorithm,
// ! -> If we sort N-1 items, the SMALLEST element will be at its correct position by default

// * This leads us to our first improvement:
// * -> WE ONLY NEED TO RUN THE OUTER LOOP N-1 TIMES, INSTEAD OF N TIMES

// ! So our improved algorithm now looks like this
// * Bubble Sort algorithm - outer loop optimized
for (let k = 0; k < myList.length - 1; k++) {
	for (let i = 0; i < myList.length - 1; i++) {
		if (myList[i] > myList[i + 1]) {
			// Swap
			let temp = myList[i]
			myList[i] = myList[i + 1]
			myList[i + 1] = temp
		}
	}
}

// ! This small change in the outer loop, makes it so we loop through
// ! every element in the array ONE ITERATION LESS
// ! Imagine if we had an array of 1 million elements -> this would be a great speed boost then!

// ! We CAN stop here, but there is one more optimization that we can make
// ! And its the one what will really speed up our algorithm
